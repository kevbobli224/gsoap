\description{
The data contains results of the pathway over-representation enrichment
analysis of the paradoxical genes obtained from pathDIP (Rahmati et al, 2016).
These genes were found deregulated in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and were termed
paradoxical because their copy number aberrations are in contrast to
their differential expression status (Tokar et al., 2018).
}
\note{
The results of the pathway enrichment analysis in this data set
and in the original paper may differ, due to the different pathDIP
version used.
